# 100 Days of Code: Python Challenge

Welcome to my journey of 100 Days of Code! This challenge is all about improving my Python skills by coding every day for 100 days straight. I'll document my progress, challenges, and learnings here as a log. Join me as I grow and explore the world of Python programming!

---

## Rules
1. Code for at least one hour every day.
2. Log my progress daily in this README file.
3. Share my progress on social media to stay accountable.
4. Focus on Python, but explore as needed.

## Goals
1. Finish the 100 Day Python Course
2. Progress in the Complete Scientific Computing with Python from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## Log
### Day 1: January 23, 2025
üñ•Ô∏è **Today's Progress:**
- Set up dev environment & repository
- Completed Day 1 of Python course
- Built a cipher & learned string manipulation on FreeCodeCamp
- Created a fun Madlibs script!

üí≠**Thoughts:**
Getting up and running in VSCode was more involved then I anticipated.  I am really looking forward to learning data persistence and how to build a UI.  Python has some really neat features and I am having blast!

### Day 2: January 24, 2025
üñ•Ô∏è **Today's Progress:**
- Researched and signed up for several practice / challenge sites
- Fixed some errors in the Madlibs script from Day 1
- Made an Ideas file
- Completed Day 2 of Python course
- Implemented the Luhn Algorithm to build a credit card verification 
- Looked into GUI resources

üí≠**Thoughts:**
I got side tracked by some of neat ideas to make the Madlibs script from day 1 more fun while showing it off. Because I was not working on todays project I feel like the time was wasted in a way.  I do want to be able to have these ideas and take action on them at some point so I made a place for them to live while they wait. Looking into GUI info was overwhelming!

### Day 3: January 25, 2025
üñ•Ô∏è **Today's Progress:**
- Completed Day 3 of Python course


üí≠**Thoughts:**
I looked at a few larger python based open source projects today. I did not fully understand the hows and whys of most of what I saw; but, I now have a deeper appreciation for comments and really want to work on making sure that I get into the habit of commenting as I code.

### Day 4: January 26, 2025
üñ•Ô∏è **Today's Progress:**
- Completed (some) of Day 4 of Python course
- Worked with modules and lists with a focus on using nested lists. 


üí≠**Thoughts:**
Navigating through nested lists is a bit tricky but I am sure in time it will be something I don't have to think so hard about! I did nto have a ton of time to work today so was not able to finish all the items in day 4... I was trying to quickly finish the Rock, Paper, Scissors game to finish teh day out.. but sleep is calling.  I will enjoy getting it done tomorrow with a fresh brain!
