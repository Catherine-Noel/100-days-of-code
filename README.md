## Log
### Day 1: January 23, 2025
üñ•Ô∏è **Today's Progress:**
- Set up dev environment & repository
- Completed Day 1 of a Python course
- Built a cipher & learned string manipulation on FreeCodeCamp
- Created a fun Madlibs script!

üí≠**Thoughts:**
Getting up and running in VSCode was more involved then I anticipated.  I am really looking forward to learning data persistence and how to build a UI.  Python has some really neat features and I am having blast!
